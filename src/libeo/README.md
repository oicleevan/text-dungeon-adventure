# libeo

A library with various stuff that I found useful for my game [The Deeps](../../README.md). 

If this gets large enough and it is usable for multiple projects, I may post it separately.

## building

i've provided a bash script to automate the build process. execute `bash ./build.sh` in this directory to build it. otherwise, a library should already be included!
