A text-based adventure game/dungeon crawler written in good ol' C++. Defeat enemies as you delve into a dungeon in search of treasure! 

**RELEASE 2.0 OUT NOW! TECHNICALLY AN ACTUAL THING NOW!**

## what is this game?

This game is text-based, and runs in a terminal. You play as a character who delves into a dungeon, where ghastly enemies hope to stop you from finding the hidden treasure.

As you fight and defeat enemies, you grow stronger. But be weary, so do the enemies...;

Use your tactics and skill to defeat these enemies and claim your prize!

## how to play

You can download the `adventure_linux` file from [the release section](https://github.com/oicleevan/text-dungeon-adventure/releases/). Make it executable with `chmod +x adventure_linux`. 

You can then launch it from a terminal with `./adventure_linux`. (Pre-release candidates do not include a binary, you must compile from source.)

*A binary distribution is also included in the source code, at `bin/`. You can execute it in a terminal with `bin/adventure`.*

## building from source

To make the software, GNU make is required. Type `make` to compile the program. It places a binary in `bin/`.

Currently only supports Linux-based systems. I don't have a Windows or MacOS machine to test on, so if anyone wishes to port this, that would be great!

# Thanks!
