# oicleevan's text based dungeon crawler

A text-based adventure game/dungeon crawler written in pure C++. Defeat enemies as you delve into a dungeon in search of treasure!

## what is this game?

This game is text-based, and runs in a terminal. You play as a character who delves into a dungeon, where ghastly enemies hope to stop you from finding the hidden treasure.

As you fight and defeat enemies, you grow stronger. But be weary, so do the enemies...;

Use your tactics and skill to defeat these enemies and claim your prize!

## setup

To make the software, GNU make is required. Type `make` to compile the program. It places a binary in `bin/`.

Currently only supports UNIX based systems. I don't have a Windows machine to test on, so if anyone wishes to port this to Windows, that would be great!

## running

A binary distribution is included in `bin/`. You can execute it in a terminal with `bin/adventure`.
