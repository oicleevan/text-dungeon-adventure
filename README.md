# oicleevan's text based dungeon crawler

A text-based adventure game/dungeon crawler. Defeat enemies as you delve into a dungeon in search of treasure!

## setup

To make the software, GNU make is required. Type `make all` to compile the program. It places a binary in `bin/`.

Currently only supports UNIX based systems. Don't have a Windows machine to test on.

## running

A binary distribution is included in `bin/`. You can execute it in a terminal with `bin/adventure`.

# Thanks!
